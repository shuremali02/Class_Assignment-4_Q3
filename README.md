## 📝 Assignment List

### ✅ 1. List Methods Practice
Practice common list operations such as adding, inserting, removing elements, copying, slicing, and sorting.

### ✅ 2. Dictionary Methods Practice
Work with dictionary creation, modification, key-value operations, and combining dictionaries.

### ✅ 3. Shopping Discount Calculator
Simulate a real-world discount system based on purchase value, loyalty status, weekends, and holidays using if-statements.

### ✅ 4. For Loop Number Patterns
Use `for` loops to print counting numbers and a multiplication table.

### ✅ 5. While Loop Interactive Game
Create a simple number guessing game using a `while` loop and input logic.

### ✅ 6. Student Grade Management System
Manage a list of students where each student has multiple course grades. Perform operations such as:
- Adding students
- Calculating averages
- Finding toppers
- Filtering high performers
- Course-wise average
